## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for my project for the Business Information System course. The project is centered around the Business Process Intelligence (BPI) Challenge 2020, which involves analyzing a real-world business process and identifying areas for improvement.


## Business Analysis
The BPI Challenge 2020 involved analyzing the process of loan applications at a financial institution. The project was carried out in several stages, including:

1. Data collection: I collected event logs related to business travel using the Disco software and Python library PM4PY.

2. Process mining: I used process mining techniques to generate several models, including Alpha Miner, Inductive Miner, Inductive Miner infrequent, Inductive Miner directly-follows, and Heuristic Miner.

3. Model evaluation: I evaluated the models using Petri nets and calculated the fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity of each model.

4. Conclusion: Based on the results of the model evaluation, I identified the best model to apply to TU/e's business travel process.

Tools Used
To complete this project, I used the following tools:

- PM4PY: An open-source platform for process mining written in Python.

- Disco: A process mining tool capable of handling event logs, complex patterns, and data filtering.

- Google Colab: A cloud-based platform for writing and executing Python code, particularly well-suited for machine learning, data analysis, and training.
